Exploratory data analysis of the famous Palmer Penguins dataset from Kaggle.

### Skills demonstrated
- Data cleaning and manipulation with pandas
- Data visualization with matplotlib/seaborn
- Insights on species distribution, flipper length, and body mass
- Exported charts

### Next steps
Will extend this project with a classification model once I learn machine learning.
